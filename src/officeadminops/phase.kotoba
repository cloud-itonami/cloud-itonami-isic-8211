  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout for the ISIC-8211 'Combined office
  administrative service activities' outsourced back-office operations-
  coordination actor.

    Phase 0  read-only              -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-logging       -- task-record logging allowed,
                                       every write needs human approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-coordination  -- adds staffing/task-assignment
                                       scheduling and supply-order
                                       proposals, still approval-gated.
    Phase 3  supervised auto        -- governor-clean, high-confidence
                                       `:log-task-record`/
                                       `:schedule-service-operation`/
                                       `:coordinate-supply-order` may
                                       auto-commit. `:flag-
                                       confidentiality-concern` NEVER
                                       auto-commits, at any phase, and a
                                       high-cost `:coordinate-supply-
                                       order` still escalates even at
                                       phase 3 (the governor's own
                                       `high-stakes?` keeps it out of
                                       `:commit`).

  `:flag-confidentiality-concern` is deliberately ABSENT from every
  phase's `:auto` set, including phase 3 -- a permanent structural fact,
  not a rollout milestone still to come. Flagging a confidentiality
  concern always needs a human to actually look at it.
  `officeadminops.governor`'s own `always-escalate-ops` enforces the same
  invariant independently -- two layers, not one, agree on this."
